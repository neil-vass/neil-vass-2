Right poster says Swiss Dots presents a documentary film by Gary Hustwit, and has the word Helvetica written twice, interlocking and spread over several lines."

As part of “[The story so far](../index.markdown#the-story-so-far)” I [learned just enough HTML and CSS](./2025-04-17-learning-just-enough-html-and-css.markdown) to know how to lay out text, images and other things on a page. This lets me change the default styling of Times New Roman text with close-together lines that run right up to the edge of the browser window into anything else I like. But I struggled a little with finding something I *did* like! 

Changing fonts, spacing and other things still left me feeling pages looked like walls of text or distractingly spaced out. Similar amounts of content on my main [neil-vass.com blog](https://neil-vass.com/) or [other sites](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/the-importance-of-learning-css/) look much more readable and inviting. This is a topic I'd like to get better at in general: how can I know what'll look good, or what tweaks to try when I'm not happy with something? Since most of the content right now is text, that means learning a little typography. I know this is a huge topic so I don't expect to get expert in it, but since I’m starting from pretty much zero knowledge I’m sure a little learning will make a big difference.
