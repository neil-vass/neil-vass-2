                <p>As part of of "<a href="./index.htm#the-story-so-far">The story so far</a>" I was looking for an easy way to get one static page at the <a href="./registering-a-domain-name.htm">neil-vass-2.com domain I registered</a>, so you can see "Hello, World!" when you go to that URL. What's an easy way to do that?</p>
                <p>Did you know? You don't even need HTML for this - a text file with those words in it would work fine. Looking at that in a web browser's inspector tools show that the basic HTML wrapping gets assumed.</p>
