        <h1>Registering a domain name</h1>

        <p>As part of "<a href="./index.htm#the-story-so-far">The story so far</a>" in setting up this site, I registered the neil-vass-2.com domain name. This was fairly simple:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Went to <a href="https://123-reg.co.uk">123-reg.co.uk</a> (a domain name registrar)</li>
          <li>Searched for the domain I wanted, found it's available</li>
          <li>Clicked to register it for 3 years (1 penny for the first year! And Â£17.99 for subsequent years)</li>
          <li>Put in my contact details, payment details, and it was done.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now, I have a 123-reg account where I can manage various things about this domain - including changing the <a href="https://www.secureserver.net/help/what-is-dns-665?plid=587240">DNS (Domain Name System) records</a>. That'll be important very soon.</p>
