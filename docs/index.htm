        <h1>Just one static page</h1>

        <p>I've been blogging at <a href="https://neil-vass.com">neil-vass.com</a> for a few years, but recently decided to try starting this second site. For more background, see <a href="https://neil-vass.com/blogging-about-blogging-just-this-once/">Blogging about blogging, just this once</a> over on the main blog.</p>

        <p>That post ended with a summary of my aims for this new site:</p>

        <blockquote>
          So, what am I hoping to get out of this?
            <ul>
              <li>Get a blog setup that I'd be happier to use - and then switch <a href="https://neil-vass.com">neil-vass.com</a> to use it!</li>
              <li>Learn things</li>
              <li>Have fun</li>
            </ul>
            Let's see how it goesâ€¦

        <h2>The story so far</h2>
        <p>
          I registered <a href="https://neil-vass-2.com">neil-vass-2.com</a> using <a href="https://www.123-reg.co.uk">123 Reg</a>, and got just one static page showing there. GitHub Pages was a straightforward way to do that.
        </p>

        <p>Next: a few more notes on how I got that in place, then on to adding more features to this very very simple blog.</p>
