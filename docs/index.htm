        <h1>Just one static page</h1>

        <p>I've been blogging at <a href="https://neil-vass.com">neil-vass.com</a> for a few years, but recently decided to try starting this second site. For more background, see <a href="https://neil-vass.com/blogging-about-blogging-just-this-once/">Blogging about blogging, just this once</a> over on the main blog.</p>

        <p>That post ended with a summary of my aims for this new site:</p>

        <blockquote>
          So, what am I hoping to get out of this?
            <ul>
              <li>Get a blog setup that I'd be happier to use - and then switch <a href="https://neil-vass.com">neil-vass.com</a> to use it!</li>
              <li>Learn things</li>
              <li>Have fun</li>
            </ul>
            Let's see how it goesâ€¦
        </blockquote>

        <h2>A blog setup I'd be happier to use</h2>
        <p>There's every chance I'll conclude that the kind of setup I was already using was the right one - but I want to see the need for it. This might be a very long way round, but I'm planning to start from the very basics, and only add more tools as I realise what I'm missing, and see what an extra bit of complication might help me with.</p>

        <h2>Learning things</h2>
        <p>I'm expecting to encounter 3 different types of learning as I get to each topic needed to make this site:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I used to know about this, but it's been a long time and I've forgotten</li>
          <li>I never knew too much about this to begin with</li>
          <li>Lots of what I did know is out of date, things have changed</li>
        </ol>

        <p>As an example: last year I started learning JavaScript, and found all 3 of these reasons applied. Type 1 because it's been years since I used it, and lots of things are different from languages I'm more used to. Type 2 because I never used it all that much, or for anything very complicated - so I wasn't very expert even before forgetting things. And type 3 because JavaScript has come a long way in the meantime (there's so many improvements!). Surprisingly, it still didn't feel like I was starting completely from scratch, enough of what I remembered still applied to feel like a useful head start.</p>
        
        <p>I might adjust this list of learning reasons if I realise something else fits better. Maybe there's some kind of standard list that applies?</p>

        <h2>Having fun</h2>
        <p>I'm expecting learning to be fun - I enjoy seeing how things work and it's satisfying to get better at things - but if any topic starts to feel like a slog I'm very prepared to back off and try something else instead.</p>

        <h2>The story so far</h2>
        <p>You're reading this on <a href="https://neil-vass-2.com">neil-vass-2.com</a> so I've definitely made some progress on getting a new site in place! So far I have...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bought a domain name</li> 
          <li>Looked at running it off my laptop (is <em>that</em> the simplest next step?)</li>
          <li>Set up GitHub pages to host the site</li>
          <li>(Re)learned enough HTML and CSS to write these pages you're reading</li>
        </ul>
