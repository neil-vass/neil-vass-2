    <h1>Just one static page</h1>

    <p>
      I've registered <a href="https://neil-vass-2.com">neil-vass-2.com</a> (used 123 reg), there's not much there yet.

      I'd like to get just one static page, so you can see “Hello, World!” when you go to that URL. What's an easy way to do that?
      GitHub Pages looks straightforward!
