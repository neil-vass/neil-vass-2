title: A blog about blogging
---

I've been blogging at [neil-vass.com](https://neil-vass.com) for a few years, but recently decided to try starting this second site. For more background, see [Blogging about blogging, just this once](https://neil-vass.com/blogging-about-blogging-just-this-once/) over on the main blog.

That post ended with a summary of my aims for this new site:


> So, what am I hoping to get out of this?
>   * Get a blog setup that I'd be happier to use - and then switch [neil-vass.com](https://neil-vass.com) to use it!
>   * Learn things
>   * Have fun
>
> Let's see how it goes…


A blog setup I'd be happier to use
----------------------------------

There's every chance I'll conclude that the kind of setup I was already using was the right one - but I want to see the need for it. This might be a very long way round, but I'm planning to start from the very basics, and only add more tools as I realise what I'm missing, and see what an extra bit of complication might help me with.


Learning things
---------------

{% include types-of-learning-description.markdown %}

I think I'll refer to these learning types lots of times, so I've [repeated them on their own page](./types-of-learning.markdown).


Having fun
----------

I'm expecting learning to be fun - I enjoy seeing how things work and it's satisfying to get better at things - but if any topic starts to feel like a slog I'm very prepared to back off and try something else instead.


The story so far
----------------

You're reading this on [neil-vass-2.com](https://neil-vass-2.com) so I've definitely made some progress on getting a new site in place! So far I have…

*   [Looked at running it off my laptop](./_posts/2025-04-14-running-a-site-from-my-laptop.markdown) (is _that_ the simplest next step?)
*   [Set up GitHub pages to host the site](./_posts/2025-04-14-setting-up-github-pages.markdown)
*   [(Re)learned enough HTML and CSS to write these pages you're reading](./_posts/2025-04-17-learning-just-enough-html-and-css.markdown)
