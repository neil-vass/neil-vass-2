Just one static page
====================

I've been blogging at [neil-vass.com](https://neil-vass.com) for a few years, but recently decided to try starting this second site. For more background, see [Blogging about blogging, just this once](https://neil-vass.com/blogging-about-blogging-just-this-once/) over on the main blog.

That post ended with a summary of my aims for this new site:


> So, what am I hoping to get out of this?
>   * Get a blog setup that I'd be happier to use - and then switch [neil-vass.com](https://neil-vass.com) to use it!
>   * Learn things
>   * Have fun
>
> Let's see how it goesâ€¦


A blog setup I'd be happier to use
----------------------------------

There's every chance I'll conclude that the kind of setup I was already using was the right one - but I want to see the need for it. This might be a very long way round, but I'm planning to start from the very basics, and only add more tools as I realise what I'm missing, and see what an extra bit of complication might help me with.


Learning things
---------------

I'm expecting to encounter 3 different types of learning as I get to each topic needed to make this site:

1. I used to know about this, but it's been a long time and I've forgotten
2. I never knew too much about this to begin with
3. Lots of what I did know is out of date, things have changed


As an example: last year I started learning JavaScript, and found all 3 of these reasons applied. Type 1 because it's been years since I used it, and lots of things are different from languages I'm more used to. Type 2 because I never used it all that much, or for anything very complicated - so I wasn't very expert even before forgetting things. And type 3 because JavaScript has come a long way in the meantime (there's so many improvements!). Surprisingly, it still didn't feel like I was starting completely from scratch, enough of what I remembered still applied to feel like a useful head start.

I might adjust this list of learning reasons if I realise something else fits better. Maybe there's some kind of standard list that applies?

I think I'll refer to these learning types lots of times, so I've [repeated them on their own page](./types-of-learning.htm).


Having fun
----------

I'm expecting learning to be fun - I enjoy seeing how things work and it's satisfying to get better at things - but if any topic starts to feel like a slog I'm very prepared to back off and try something else instead.


The story so far

You're reading this on [neil-vass.com](https://neil-vass.com) so I've definitely made some progress on getting a new site in place! So far I have...
*   [Registered a domain name](./registering-a-domain-name.htm)
*   [Looked at running it off my laptop](./running-a-site-from-my-laptop.htm) (is _that_ the simplest next step?)
*   [Set up GitHub pages to host the site](./setting-up-github-pages.htm)
*   (Re)learned enough HTML and CSS to write these pages you're reading
